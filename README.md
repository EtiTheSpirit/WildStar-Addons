# WildStar-Addons
A repo for all of the addons I've developed for WildStar
I won't be putting code in the repository. All code will be in a zip file found in the releases tab.

# Mod Information
All of the info you need to know about the mods is inside of the zip file.

# Details on codewriting
I am a strange codewriter. In Lua I tend to not use camelcase (for some strange reason) despite using it elsewhere. That said, the way I write is certainly not lazy. All variable names are descriptive to their purpose, I have comments placed frequently to describe functionality of things and clarify potentially vague information, and in general the end result is code that is fairly easy to understand.

**Feel free to grab any of these mods and make your own versions of them! As mentioned in the license, all you have to do is give me credit in some way. Linking to this github repo is acceptable.**
